            <h2>hi i'm dan</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my first ever web page. I'm learning web development and this is my first site. It's built using HTML and CSS code, something that is completely new to me. Over the next few months I wish to improve upon my skills as a junior web developer and start to learn Javascript and version control using Git. You can check out my GitHub profile by clicking here.</p>
            
            <h3>without struggle there is no progress</h3>
            
            <p>I am thirty four years of age and currently living in a quiet town within Suffolk. I was born and raised in Walthamstow, London. At a young age I developed a talent for all things creative. Upon growing up my family decided to move from the big city to a more quiet area of the world. From attending school in my early teen years, the passion that I had for a creative edge, grew.</p>
            <p>From this creative spark as a young person, it then kept with me until now. In my spare time I like to draw using pencil and digital art through Adobe Photoshop. With in the past few years I have been interested in creating stencil art. This consists of designing my own artistic pieces and transferring them to card where the design is cut out and sprayed onto a blank canvas using high quality spray paint materials.</p>
